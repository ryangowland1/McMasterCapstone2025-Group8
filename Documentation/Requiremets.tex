\section{Purpose and Scope}

This document specifies the system requirements for developing an autonomous parking system using 1/10th scale cars as part of the Mini MacCity project, funded by McMaster Universityâ€™s Centre for Software Certification. It outlines the functional, safety, and design requirements that the system must fulfill to ensure successful implementation and team alignment.

\section{Definitions}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Parking Line}: A line that marks the boundary between parking spots.
